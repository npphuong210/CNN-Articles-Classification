after the Biden administration laid out the details of a $105 billion national security package that includes funding for both Israel and Ukraine, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would bring the supplemental request to the floor as soon as next week.\n","\n","But the effort faces steep hurdles in getting through Congress. Among them: The House and Senate are divided over whether to continue sending aid to Ukraine, and Republican lawmakers want to tie the funding to tightening immigration laws.\n","\n","The supplemental package would provide security support to Israel, bolster Israeli efforts to secure the release of hostages and extend humanitarian aid to civilians affected by the war in Israel and Gaza, according to a White House fact sheet released in October.\n","It would also provide training, equipment and weapons to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia’s invasion and to recapture its territory, as well as to protect Ukrainians from Russian aggression, the fact sheet said.\n","\n","The package would also include additional funds to support US-Mexico border security, including more patrol agents, machines to detect fentanyl, asylum officers and immigration judge teams. Plus, it would provide funding to strengthen security in the Indo-Pacific region, including Taiwan.\n","$61.4 billion in aid for Ukraine\n","$30 billion for the Defense Department for equipment for Ukraine and the replenishment of US stocks. So far, the US has provided Ukraine with air defense systems, munitions, small arms and ground maneuver units, among other weapons and equipment.\n","$14.4 billion for continued military, intelligence and other defense support. This includes investments in the defense industrial base, transportation costs of US personnel and equipment, and continuing an enhanced US troop presence in Europe, among other activities.\n","$16.3 billion for economic, security and operational assistance. It includes direct budget support to Ukraine to help it provide critical services to its people and sustain its economy, as well as investments in infrastructure, civilian law enforcement and getting rid of mines.\n","$481 million to support Ukrainians arriving in the US through the Uniting for Ukraine program.\n","$149 million for the National Nuclear Security Administration for nuclear/radiological incident response and capacity building in case of emergencies as part of general\n","$14.3 billion in aid for Israel\n","$10.6 billion for assistance through the Defense Department, including air and missile defense support, industrial base investments and replenishment of US stocks being drawn down to support Israel.\n","The aid aims to bolster Israel’s air and missile defense system readiness and support its procurement of Iron Dome and David’s Sling missile defense systems and components, as well as the development of the Iron Beam.\n","$3.7 billion for the State Department to strengthen Israel’s military and enhance US Embassy security.\n","$10 billion for humanitarian assistance\n","$9.15 billion for aid for Ukraine, Israel, Gaza and other humanitarian needs.

result in serious and even deadly infections. But in a study published Wednesday in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, one-third of respondents to a survey incorrectly answered that tap water does not contain bacteria or other living organisms.In the August 2021 survey, more than half of 1,004 survey participants incorrectly said that tap water can be used for nasal rinsing, 50% believed is appropriate for rinsing contact lenses and 42% trusted it is safe for use in respiratory devices such as humidifiers or CPAP – continuous positive airway pressure – machines, which are used to treat sleep apnea.Shanna Miko, an author of the study and Epidemic Intelligence Service officer at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, says these findings highlight misconceptions about the safe use of nonsterile tap water for medical devices at home.“While tap water is generally safe to drink, it is not OK for other uses,” Miko said.Although US tap water is treated to meet safe drinking standards, it may contain low levels of microorganisms.These microbes are generally harmless when ingested during drinking and cooking because they are killed by stomach acid. However, when irrigating the nose or eyes, they may cause serious and even deadly infections.“With the aging infrastructure, our aging pipes, there are some new waterborne challenges that have emerged, and those are basically these pathogens or these germs that can live in these protective areas that like to stick to pipes called biofilm pathogens,” Miko said.Pathogens found in tap water systems – including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, nontuberculous mycobacteria, Legionella, Acanthamoeba and Naegleria fowleri – can invade the lungs, brain, eyes or skin.Several cases of brain-eating amoeba have been reported from neti pots, devices used to flush nasal passages. There have also been multi-state outbreaks of Acanthamoeba from improper contact lens rinsing, which can cause blindness and other permanent eye damage.“They might not be the most frequent things to be occurring each year,” Miko said, “but to the people that do acquire the infections, it has a significant impact.”Most healthy people exposed to these microbes will not get sick. However, certain groups of people may be at a higher risk of serious infection. These include older people, infants younger than 6 months, and those with weakened immune systems or other chronic health issues such as cancer, HIV or lung disease.“We want them to know that even though they’re at higher risk for infections of these waterborne associated pathogens, there are simple steps that they can take to reduce their risks,” Miko said.The CDC recommends individuals using at-home medical devices like CPAP machines, humidifiers and neti pots only use water free from microbes such as distilled or sterile water, which can be bought in stores. Boiled and cooled water may also be used.In addition to using distilled, sterile or previously boiled water, individuals can decrease their exposure to microbes by regularly cleaning and disinfecting at-home medical devices.For populations at higher risk, Miko recommends flushing plumbing systems regularly and applying special filters on faucets or showers. She notes that most pitcher, refrigerator and sink water filters are not designed to remove germs from water.“This data isn’t meant to scare anybody. We have one of the best public water drinking systems in the world,” Miko said.She encourages people to follow guidance on safe water practices for at-home medical devices which can be found on the CDC website.“If we can just do something as simple as boiling water or using sterile distilled water to reduce the risk, that’s something we’d like to share with people,” Miko said.'''"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"ngqYUyLpiuYG"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Convert the text to BOW representation\n","new_bow = vectorizer.transform([text])\n","# Make a prediction\n","predicted_category = svm_classifier.predict(new_bow)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"iWL3-oz9ivAG","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1709386481760,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"Ngọc Phương Lương","userId":"01871064470542091757"}},"outputId":"d67db438-908d-4108-bf9a-6fd6139c3820"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["[2.]\n"]}],"source":["print(predicted_category)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"saWvaHORvuiy"},"source":["# ***Nerual Network 3️⃣***"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"oiU0kA2Xu2yF"},"source":["## **Implement**"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"REsFNG0xfDiz"},"outputs":[],"source":["import tensorflow as tf\n","import pandas as pd\n","from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer\n","from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences\n","from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential\n","from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding, LSTM, Dense, Dropout\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import MultiLabelBinarizer\n","from keras.regularizers import l2"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"bTLmGz1fhcEN"},"outputs":[],"source":["file_path = '/content/New_Crawler_After_EDA_And_Complete_Processing.csv'\n","df = pd.read_csv(file_path, lineterminator='\\n')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"09oaM5pHhnf0"},"outputs":[],"source":["import tensorflow as tf\n","\n","# Đường dẫn tới tệp .h5 chứa mô hình đã được lưu\n","model_path = \"/content/drive/MyDrive/Bản sao của Seq_model1.h5\"\n","\n","# Tải mô hình từ tệp .h5\n","model = tf.keras.models.load_model(model_path)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":608},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":1009,"status":"ok","timestamp":1708687381106,"user":{"displayName":"Phuong Luong","userId":"04270914777314777405"},"user_tz":-420},"id":"zd5t1LsTpQWe","outputId":"bbdb9064-3565-45c0-acac-b67dfdeaf970"},"outputs":[{"data":{"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"repr_error":"'str' object has no attribute 'empty'","type":"dataframe","variable_name":"df"},"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-a12dec42-5377-4b74-8e39-48aeca820a23\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>Index</th>\n","      <th>Author</th>\n","      <th>Date_Published</th>\n","      <th>Category</th>\n","      <th>Url</th>\n","      <th>Headline</th>\n","      <th>Description</th>\n","      <th>Keywords</th>\n","      <th>Article_Text</th>\n","      <th>tokenization</th>\n","      <th>Category_Encoded</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>Nathaniel Meyersohn, CNN Business</td>\n","      <td>2022-03-19 12:10:14</td>\n","      <td>business</td>\n","      <td>https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/19/business/kohls-...</td>\n","      <td>How Kohl's became such a mess -

= \"\"\"\n","\n","Josh Brolin is known as a doting father and movie star of epic proportions, but above all, the man is a gifted wordsmith.\n","\n","Brolin – who plays Gurney Halleck in the Denis Villeneuve “Dune” movies – took a more creative approach to promoting the franchise’s second installment “Dune: Part Two” this week, by writing a unique summary of the film on social media that reads less like formulaic promotional prose and more like a Hollywood-themed riddle.\n","\n","“DUNE 2 release is less than TWO WEEKS!!! Robot Lady and Wonka fall in love. Then Elvis tries to f— it all up while his bad dad floats in a pool of pond scum,” Brolin wrote on his Instagram page Tuesday. “The WWE dude from Gardians (sic) gets super pissed while Midsomer (sic) hottie puts the eyes on Wonka Obi Wan just after his Mom gets caught taking LSD in a sandy bathroom. Chigurh still doesnt like the guy from The Goonies.”\n","\n","Confused? Let’s take a moment to decode which of Brolin’s “Dune: Part Two” co-stars he mentions and what on earth – or Arrakis – he’s talking about in this caption.\n","\n","To start, we’re going to presume “Robot lady” is referring to Zendaya, based on this futuristic ensemble she wore to the London premiere of “Dune: Part Two” last week. And “Wonka” is obviously Timothée Chalamet, who starred as the famed chocolatier in the 2023 film and leads “Dune: Part Two” as Paul Atreides. (Both “Dune” and “Wonka” are distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, which like CNN is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery.)\n","\n","“Elvis,” of course, is Austin Butler – who still can’t seem to shake that accent after starring in 2022’s Baz Luhrmann biopic on the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll – and Brolin’s mention of “bad dad” is likely a reference to Stellan Skarsgård’s evil “Dune” character Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (who really does float in a pool of scum).\n","\n","That “WWE dude” from the “Guardians of the Galaxy” franchise is Dave Bautista – who plays Glossu Rabban in the “Dune” universe – and the “hottie” is Florence Pugh, who starred in the horror film “Midsommar.”\n","\n","With us so far? Great, moving on. Rebecca Ferguson is the “Mom” that Brolin mentions in reference to a certain psychedelic, which in the “Dune” universe is actually a fictional drug called Melange.\n","To finish, Javier Bardem played a the villainous Anton Chigurh in “No Country for Old Men” (and won an Oscar for it), and Brolin himself is the “guy from The Goonies.” Both actors, of course, figure in the second “Dune” installment, hitting theaters next week.\n","\n","After the cryptic references in his post, Brolin then focused on the magic of the movies to bring things home. “I mean who doesn’t want to see all that on IMAX,” he continued to write, going on to urge his followers to “commune again and experience that amazing feeling of when the lights go down… and DUNE 2 consumes you.”\n","\n","Christopher Walken, Léa Seydoux and Charlotte Rampling round out the all-star cast of “Dune: Part 2,” which is the sequel to 2021’s “Dune” and focuses on the rise of Chalamet’s heroic Paul Atreides.\n","\n","The movie franchise is based on the classic 1965 “Dune” sci-fi novel by the late Frank Herbert.\n","\n","“Dune: Part Two” will premiere in theaters on March 1.\n","”\"\"\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":8,"status":"ok","timestamp":1708690484154,"user":{"displayName":"Phuong

Robot Lady and Wonka fall in love. Then Elvis tries to f— it all up while his bad dad floats in a pool of pond scum,” Brolin wrote on his Instagram page Tuesday. “The WWE dude from Gardians (sic) gets super pissed while Midsomer (sic) hottie puts the eyes on Wonka Obi Wan just after his Mom gets caught taking LSD in a sandy bathroom. Chigurh still doesnt like the guy from The Goonies.”\n","\n","Confused? Let’s take a moment to decode which of Brolin’s “Dune: Part Two” co-stars he mentions and what on earth – or Arrakis – he’s talking about in this caption.\n","\n","To start, we’re going to presume “Robot lady” is referring to Zendaya, based on this futuristic ensemble she wore to the London premiere of “Dune: Part Two” last week. And “Wonka” is obviously Timothée Chalamet, who starred as the famed chocolatier in the 2023 film and leads “Dune: Part Two” as Paul Atreides. (Both “Dune” and “Wonka” are distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, which like CNN is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery.)\n","\n","“Elvis,” of course, is Austin Butler – who still can’t seem to shake that accent after starring in 2022’s Baz Luhrmann biopic on the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll – and Brolin’s mention of “bad dad” is likely a reference to Stellan Skarsgård’s evil “Dune” character Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (who really does float in a pool of scum).\n","\n","That “WWE dude” from the “Guardians of the Galaxy” franchise is Dave Bautista – who plays Glossu Rabban in the “Dune” universe – and the “hottie” is Florence Pugh, who starred in the horror film “Midsommar.”\n","\n","With us so far? Great, moving on. Rebecca Ferguson is the “Mom” that Brolin mentions in reference to a certain psychedelic, which in the “Dune” universe is actually a fictional drug called Melange.\n","To finish, Javier Bardem played a the villainous Anton Chigurh in “No Country for Old Men” (and won an Oscar for it), and Brolin himself is the “guy from The Goonies.” Both actors, of course, figure in the second “Dune” installment, hitting theaters next week.\n","\n","After the cryptic references in his post, Brolin then focused on the magic of the movies to bring things home. “I mean who doesn’t want to see all that on IMAX,” he continued to write, going on to urge his followers to “commune again and experience that amazing feeling of when the lights go down… and DUNE 2 consumes you.”\n","\n","Christopher Walken, Léa Seydoux and Charlotte Rampling round out the all-star cast of “Dune: Part 2,” which is the sequel to 2021’s “Dune” and focuses on the rise of Chalamet’s heroic Paul Atreides.\n","\n","The movie franchise is based on the classic 1965 “Dune” sci-fi novel by the late Frank Herbert.\n","\n","“Dune: Part Two” will premiere in theaters on March 1.\n","”\"\"\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":8,"status":"ok","timestamp":1708690484154,"user":{"displayName":"Phuong
