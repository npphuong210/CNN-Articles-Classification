# Articles Classification from CNN.com
The goal of this project is to **classify articles** on CNN.com into 5 categories such as **Business, Entertainment, Health, Politics, Sport**; using Machine Learning and Deep Learning models.

## Functionality:
1. Data collection from the CNN.com website, including article headlines and content.

2. Data preprocessing, including text cleaning, stop words removal, and text vectorization.

3. Training and evaluation of the following Machine Learning and Deep Learning models:
- **Logistic Regression (LR)**

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**

- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**

5. Comparison of model performances and selection of the best-performing model.


6. Development of a web application or API to allow users to input text and predict the corresponding category.

## Technologies Used:

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries and frameworks: scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Hugging Face Transformers
- Web framework: Flask, FastAPI
